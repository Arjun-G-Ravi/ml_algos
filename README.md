# About
This is a ML library that contains many ML algorithms, ready to be called as functions. Think of this as a **'mini-sklearn'**, with some additional features.

## Current Features

 - ML Algorithms
    1. Linear Regresion
    2. Logistic Regression
    
 - STT - whisper  
 - TTS - pyttsx3 (lightweight)



## To add Features
 - Some way to create datasets
 - Some graph, heatmap visualisations?
 - CPU Usage, Ram, Exec time view
 - Pandas for db ?
 - Some way to use and finetune LLMs
 - Some easy way to implement UI (mainly for llms)
 - Huggingface support
