# About
This is a ML library that contains many ML algorithms, ready to be called as functions. Think of this as a **'mini-sklearn'**, with some additional features.

## Current Features and Algorithms

 - ML Algorithms
    1. Linear Regresion
    2. Logistic Regression
    
 - STT - whisper  
 - TTS - pyttsx3 (lightweight)



## To add Features and Algos
 - All basic ML algorithms
 - DL algos
 - Reinforcemt algos
 - Some way to use and finetune LLMs

 - Some easy way to implement UI- with pygame, curses (mainly for chat llms)
 - Huggingface support
 - Selenium web scraping for dataset
 - Some way to create datasets
 - Some graph, heatmap visualisations?
 - CPU Usage, Ram, Exec time view
 - Pandas for db ?
